   python run.py
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

### Running the Workflow

#### 1. **Complete Workflow Demo**
```bash
cd workflow
python run_workflow_demo.py
```

#### 2. **Individual System Demos**

**Dashboard Demo:**
```bash
python plumber_dashboard.py
```

**Mobile App Demo:**
```bash
python mobile_app.py
```

**Dispatch System Demo:**
```bash
python dispatch_system.py
```

## üìã Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Customer Call
1. **Customer calls** with plumbing issue
2. **AI classification** determines:
   - Issue category (leak, clog, etc.)
   - Severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Urgency level (low, medium, high, emergency)
   - Required tools and parts
   - Safety considerations
   - Estimated duration

### Phase 2: Job Assignment
1. **Priority queuing** based on urgency
2. **Technician matching** based on:
   - Skills match
   - Location proximity
   - Current availability
3. **Automatic assignment** to best technician

### Phase 3: Field Work
1. **Technician receives** job details on mobile app
2. **On-site classification** for additional details
3. **Tools and safety** checklists provided
4. **Real-time updates** to office systems

### Phase 4: Completion
1. **Job completion** with notes and parts used
2. **System updates** across all components
3. **Reporting** and analytics generation
